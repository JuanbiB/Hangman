# Hangman
Hangman Game
A classic game I decided to code up for fun, lest my Java skills get rusty. 

Note that the print statements for the welcome banner and the hangman himself seem off but they aligned once they were actually printed on the console on my Windows machine (it didn't on my Mac, but oh well). Ised the same IDE (Eclipse) and shared the files real time with Dropbox.
